### Questions
* Should we fillna inside or outside CV loop?
* Are we allowed to use X_new to train on? (KNN fillna, etc.)


### Ideas
Missing vals
* If we just take mean, probably standardize first (cuz of std)


Data comprehension
* Compute the covariance matrix
* PCA / SVD


Models
* KNN
* OLS + basis exp
* Regularization (ridge, lasso, elastic)
* QDA (other non-lin)
* Sparse DA


Model selection
* AIC =ish leave-one-out (BIC only for n>>p)
