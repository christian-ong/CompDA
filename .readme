### Questions
* Should we fillna inside or outside CV loop?
* Are we allowed to use X_new to train on? (KNN fillna, etc.)


### Ideas
Missing vals
* If we just take mean, probably standardize first (cuz of std)


Data clean / visualize
* Categorical variables: One-hot-encoding
* Compute the covariance matrix
* PCA / SVD


Models
* Simple
    * KNN
    * Random forest
    * Linear (statistical)
* OLS + basis exp
* Regularization (ridge, lasso, elastic)
* QDA (other non-lin)
* Sparse DA
* Squared variables


Model selection
* AIC =ish leave-one-out (BIC only for n>>p)


Optimize models
* Bagging
